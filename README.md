# Licence Plate Recognition with YOLOv8 C++ Inference and OpenCV DNN

This example demonstrates licence plate recognition using self-training YOLOv8 models in C++ leveraging the [OpenCV DNN module](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d0f/group__dnn.html).

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Follow these steps to set up and run the C++ inference example:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/eden-ouob/LPR-YOLOv8-CPP.git
cd LPR-YOLOv8-CPP

# 2. Using a Python virtual environment is highly recommended to avoid dependency conflicts.
python -m venv yolov8
source yolov8/bin/activate

# 3. Install Ultralytics Python package (needed for exporting models)
pip install .

# 4. Export Models: Add yolov8*.onnx and/or yolov5*.onnx models (see export instructions below)
#    Place the exported ONNX models in the current directory (YOLOv8-CPP-Inference).
yolo export model=yolov8s.pt imgsz=640,480 format=onnx opset=12 simplify=True device=0 # Example: 640x480 resolution

# 5. Update Source Code: Edit main.cpp and set the 'projectBasePath' variable
#    to the absolute path of the 'YOLOv8-CPP-Inference' directory on your system.
#    Example: std::string projectBasePath = "/path/to/your/ultralytics/examples/YOLOv8-CPP-Inference";

# 6. Configure OpenCV DNN Backend (Optional - CUDA):
#    - The default CMakeLists.txt attempts to use CUDA for GPU acceleration with OpenCV DNN.
#    - If your OpenCV build doesn't support CUDA/cuDNN, or you want CPU inference,
#      remove the CUDA-related lines from CMakeLists.txt.

# 7. Build the project
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

# 8. Run the inference executable
./Yolov8CPPInference
```

## üìù Notes

- This repository utilizes the [OpenCV DNN API](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d0f/group__dnn.html) to run [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) exported models of Ultralytics YOLOv8.
- The example models are exported with a rectangular resolution (640x480), but the code should handle models exported with different resolutions. Consider using techniques like [letterboxing](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/predict/#letterbox) if your input images have different aspect ratios than the model's training resolution, especially for square `imgsz` exports.
